This project is inspired by UCB's CS61B (Spring 2018) Project 2. The intention is for me to practice writing scalable and maintainable code. 
It is a maze-like game meant to be run locally. The game engine is created by UCB. World generation and other features done by me. 
This is still work in progress! Will aim to add new features every now and then :)
